/*
	Short description of bug: "pattern" light behaviour corrupts maps if there's an invalid character in the pattern field, along with new description
	If you input a non-integer value and then save the map, it will corrupt the map, make it unsalvageable aside from map backups, and cause the editor to crash whenever it tries to load into it.
	Currently, there are no safeguards against this behavior, and the editor has no warning about this.
	Bug report by MortissMonster

-- Place following code under default = "9050", in LIGHT_BEHAVIOURS.pattern
-- Adds warning that non-integers will be stripped from the string
			info = "0 = off, 9 = max brightness; non-integers will be removed!",

-- Place following code in onClassify under if values.pattern then
			if string.find(values.pattern, "[^%d]+") then
      -- Check if any character is not a numerical digit, then strip it from the string
			local fixedStr, replaced = string.gsub(values.pattern, "[^%d]+", "")
			-- Code attribution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62647752/lua-string-drop-non-alphanumeric-or-space
			values.pattern = fixedStr
				print("No non-integer values, sorry! Pattern has been set to " .. values.pattern .. ".")
				-- Let the user know what was changed and why
			end


-- If you want to be fancy, you could probably edit editDialogs.lua to play a bit more nicely with this light behavior, since that's where the code that makes labels red lives. However, currently, it seems to me that'd require more work on both that and this end when this solution seems to work ok. Ideally, the pattern label would turn red and not permit you to save it until you fixed it, and I'm not quite sure how to do that at the moment, sorry.
